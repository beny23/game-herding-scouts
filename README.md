# Scout Camp Setup (MVP)

Specs live in [specs/](specs/).

## Run
- Install: `npm install`
- Dev server: `npm run dev`
- Production build: `npm run build`
- Preview build: `npm run preview`

## Controls (current scaffold)
- Move leader: WASD / Arrow keys
- Interact: E
  - Near a scout: toggle Follow/Idle
  - Near a node/site: assign nearest idle scout

## Notes
- This is a minimal Phaser 3 + Vite scaffold using simple generated shapes (no external art assets yet).
- MVP pacing is sandbox (no time limit / no fail state).
