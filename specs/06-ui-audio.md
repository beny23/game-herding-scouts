# 06 — UI & Audio

## UI (Minimal)
- Checklist panel (top-left): shows tasks and progress
- Context prompt (bottom): shows what `E` will do near interactables (including assigning the nearest idle scout)
- Carry indicator (small icon): what leader/scout is carrying

## Feedback
- Highlight interactables when near
- Short text feedback: “Delivered wood”, “Tent completed”

## Audio (Optional for MVP)
- Ambient forest loop
- Footsteps
- Build/work SFX (hammer, rustle)
