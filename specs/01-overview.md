# 01 — Overview

## High Concept
A top‑down 2D game where the player controls a **Scout Leader** guiding a small group of **Scouts** to set up a campsite. The core fantasy is organizing: assigning tasks, gathering materials, and placing camp objects in the right spots.

## Theme
Scouting / outdoor camp setup: tent pitching, fire building, flag raising, teamwork.

## Target Platform
- Web (Phaser 3)
- Keyboard-first controls (gamepad optional later)

## Control Model (MVP)
- Player controls the leader only
- Scouts are commanded/automated (no direct scout control)

## Art Direction (MVP)
- Clean vector/cartoon (keep it simple; placeholders OK)

## MVP Scope
- One playable level (forest clearing)
- Leader movement + interaction
- 3 scouts with basic task AI
- Checklist tasks: tent, campfire, flag
- Simple win state

## Out of Scope (for MVP)
- Multiple levels
- Complex pathfinding (grid/A*)
- Inventory micromanagement
- Dialogue trees
- Multiplayer
